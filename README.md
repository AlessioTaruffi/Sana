# Sana
Sana is the prototype of an app to manage one's ingredients and find recipes to cook with those. The prototype was presented as the final project of the "Human Computer Interaction" exam at Sapienza University of Rome.

The app was developed following the traditional stages of development for any app: Conceptualization, Market analysis, Planning and Designing, Testing.

The app is designed to allow its user to manage his ingredients' list, track each ingredient's expiration date and look up recipes via a social panel where every user is allowed to share their cooking skills with everyone else. 

The prototype was presented as the final work of a group of 6 persons: Me, Valerio Mesiti, Gabriele Moretti, Antonio Sacco, Alessandro Pandolfi, Giacomo Porfiri.
